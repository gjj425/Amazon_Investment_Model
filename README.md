**LDA Based Amazon Investment Model**

Investment model that examines Amazon stock price outperformance related to movements driven by press releases. The model attempts to use LDA topic analysis to establish patterns of outperformance for specific topics, then attempts to test the seasonality of outperforming topics to estabish buy and sell indicators.
